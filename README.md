Week 2 homework
Did a little more than what was required. Changed position of navigation to right side on full screen, made nav buttons be center align when in drop down. Added modal component to homepage (a fun challenge). Hardest part was getting buttons to be sized and space how I wanted based on screen size.

# Date 4/25. 10:10pm. Mood: Just wokeup from a Zaxby's nap. Itis hit harder than expected, but I need more IDE time. Task: To work on my portfolio for 1 hour and see what makes.
# Task 1: Make a footer, 10:12pm.
Maybe some animation and js interactivity, lets see.
Had a quick issue with linking js, Michael was right never use your script tag in the head, leave that ish for the body, less will go wrong. I decided to go with a 45/10/45 split or whatever on the footer. Going from left to right there will be a place for a quote, after that a little fire place with animation that will bring the user to homepage, and a image of a comic strip (make it a collection).
-Note to self: You cant get ignorant and try and put floats in your bootstrap "col"'s. Lul nice try though.
